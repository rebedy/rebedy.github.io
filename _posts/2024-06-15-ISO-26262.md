## ISO26262?


---


**An international standard for automotive functional safety established by** [**ISO**](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO) **(International Organization for Standardization**)


![0](/assets/img/2024-06-15-ISO-26262.md/0.png)


**ISO26262** and [**MISRA C**](https://rebedy.github.io/posts/MISRA-C-Guideline/) are safety-related standards for automotive software and system development.

- To prevent accidents caused by errors in the E/E (Electrical and/or Electronic) system installed in the vehicle.
- ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
	- ISO 26262 specifications were officially released in 2011 as an adaptation of IEC 61508, the generic functional safety standard for E/E systems.
- ISO 26262 defines the required activities, tangible and intangible evidence, and methods used for development and production, along with a process model.
	- **Comprised of a total of 10 parts and 43 requirements and recommendations**, it defines the overall flow of hardware and software development and follows the V model development process.

#### Background

- The European Union is strengthening the mandatory installation of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are crucial components of automotive electronic control systems. This includes enforcing the mandatory installation of advanced driving assistance systems and integrated safety systems in vehicles to enhance overall road safety.
- Software-related issues are increasingly becoming significant factors in legal disputes and accidents within the international automotive industry. For example, Toyota's sudden acceleration incident was attributed to a software defect in the ECU, highlighting the critical impact of software reliability on vehicle safety.
- The importance of functional safety is growing due to the rapid proliferation of automotive ECUs and the increasing complexity of vehicle networking. As cars become more electronically sophisticated, ensuring that these systems operate safely under all conditions becomes paramount.
- As the development of ECUs by multiple suppliers becomes more common and the complexity of automotive electronic control systems continues to rise, there is a growing need for standardization. Standardizing development processes can improve efficiency, streamline collaboration among different suppliers, and significantly reduce costs.
- While IEC 61508 is a comprehensive functional safety standard for general electrical and electronic devices, it does not adequately address the unique requirements and specific characteristics of the automotive industry. This gap underscores the need for automotive-specific functional safety standards to ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability in vehicle electronic systems.

## ASIL


---


**ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level)** is a safety measurement standard divided into four levels based on the likelihood of exposure of the situation, potential severity of risk, and controllability.


**ASIL**'s rating decisions are

1. Severity (S:Severity) assessment of risk sources
2. Possibility of exposure (E:Expisure)
3. Controllability (C) assessment

each grade is classified and determined through an evaluation table.

- ASIL은 최저 등급 A부터 최고 등급 D까지 구성됨.
- ASIL이 높다는 것은 해당 개발 아이템의 오류로 인해 사고가 날 경우 상대적으로 피해가 클 수 있음을 의미한다.
그 위험을 줄이기 위해 높은 수준의 안전 메커니즘과 안전 요구 사항이 강력해져야 한다.
- IEC 61508의 SIL(Safety Integrity Level)을 차량의 특성에 맞게 조정한 것이다.
