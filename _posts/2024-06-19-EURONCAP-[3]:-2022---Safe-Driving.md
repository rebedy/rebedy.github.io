undefined- The OEM must demonstrate, by means of a **dossier**, that when faced with the following ranges and elements the DSM system is **either** **not degraded** in performance or that performance is **degraded** and the driver is informed within **10s** of the occlusion being present with visual and/or audible information.


#### a. Stature types


**Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS)**


![1](/assets/img/2024-06-19-EURONCAP-[3]:-2022---Safe-Driving.md/1.png)_https://mag.toyota.co.uk/thums/_


In 2016, Toyota expanded the virtual human models with three new models, representing children aged three, six and ten with physiques measuring 94cm, 118cm and 138cm respectively. These new models were created as a result of collaborative research with various United States universities and the Toyota Technical Center in Michigan. As with the adult models already available, they were available in either passenger or pedestrian versions.


[https://www.toyota-europe.com/news/2016/thums-is-having-a-baby#:~:text=What about child safety?,perform more thorough injury analysis](https://www.toyota-europe.com/news/2016/thums-is-having-a-baby#:~:text=What%20about%20child%20safety?,perform%20more%20thorough%20injury%20analysis).


The ten-year old (138cm tall), six-year old (118cm tall) and three-year old (94cm tall) additions to THUMS represent the average body sizes of children at each respective age. … As with the large male (189cm tall), average-build adult male (179cm tall), and small female (153cm tall) models that are already existing, the new models will come in two versions—a passenger version and a pedestrian version—for a total of six new additions to the THUMS line-up. This expanded line-up takes into consideration the influence of age and physique and allows us perform more thorough injury analysis.



#### b. Fitzpatrick **skin** types


<u>There are six Fitzpatrick skin types.</u> Skin types I to III burn easily and tan poorly. Many traditional lasers have been tested and designed for these skin types. Skin types IV to VI tend to burn less but are more prone to developing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation5 (PIH) after injury or external triggers.

## **Driver Monitoring**

### **Driver States**


![3](/assets/img/2024-06-19-EURONCAP-[3]:-2022---Safe-Driving.md/3.png)_Summary of Driver States_



### **1. Distraction**

- Anything (e.g. secondary tasks) that reduces the driver’s focus on theprimary task of driving/controlling the vehicle.


#### **1) Long Distraction**

- A single **long duration** distraction which takes the driver’s **gaze away** from the forward road view.
- **≥ 3 seconds** glance away from the forward road view (+1 second if OEM provides justification and evidence that safety is kept)

	Open image-20240214-073808.png


	Timeline for long distraction classification



#### **2) Short distraction or VATS**

- **Repeated short duration gazes away** from the forward road view, which cumulatively reduce the driver’s awareness of the driving situation, until their attention returns to the driving task for long enough for them to fully assess the driving situation.
- glances away from the forward road view for **a cumulative 10 seconds** within **a 30 second time**, where the **time period is reset if the driver’s glance returns to the forward road view for a period of ≥ 2 seconds**.
- 상기 내용 구현을 위해서 **`attendD-inspired buffer algorithm`** 방법론을 예시로 선보임(설득력 있는 다른 방법론 있다면 제시 가능)

AttenD example [0]: development of the time buffer for three consecutive one-second glances away from the **F**ield **R**elevant for **D**riving (FRD), marked dark grey, with half-second glances back to the FRD in between. Note the **0.1s** physiological adaptation delay



#### 3) Phone Use

- A subset of short distraction (**VATS**) where **the object the driver’s attention is shared with is their mobile phone.**


#### 4) Movement types

- **Owl** type movement: A shifting of visual attention away from the road and forward-facing position that is primarily achieved by head rotation followed by the eyes

![4](/assets/img/2024-06-19-EURONCAP-[3]:-2022---Safe-Driving.md/4.png)

- **Lizard** type movement: A movement in which the driver focuses on a task by moving primarily their eyeline away from the road with their head/face remaining in the forward-facing position.

### **2. Fatigue**



#### 1) Drowsy

- Classification when **KSS > 7**

- A method is needed to quantify KSS (or ‘drowsiness’) using features that can be obtained from DMS.
- [Camera-based drowsiness reference for driver state classification under real driving conditions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5548039)
	- A paper about the mapping of features that can be calculated from face/eye images and KSS


#### 2) Microsleep

- **An** **eye** closure of **< 3s**

> 3.5.3.2.2 Microsleep  
> _A common symptom of a microsleep is an eye closure of <3s although_ _Euro NCAP  
> recognises that non-eye closure microsleep events are possible._

- Measures to deal with a cognitive distraction will likely be required in the future.


#### 3) Sleep


> 3.5.3.2.3 Sleep  
> _A driver is considered to be asleep in this assessment when displaying a_ _continued eye  
> closure >3_ _seconds._



### **3. Unresponsive driver**

- likely due to a sudden onset of sickness.
- a driver who either does **not return their gaze** to the forward road view **within 3 seconds** of an inattention **warning being issued**.
- a driver whose **gaze has been away** from the forward road view for **≥ 6 seconds**.
- a driver has been **eyes closed** for **≥ 6 seconds**.


### **4. Intoxication**

- **We don’t know when it will become essential.**
- Euro NCAP에서 문제 인지 중: “25% of the fatal crashes in Europe to alcohol and other drugs.”
- Alcohol consumption - gathering evidences for changes in spatial perception
	- alcohol consumption altering oculomotor functioning
	- gaze entropy measures correlated to alcohol-induced driver impairment


### **5. Cognitive Distraction (멍때림)**

- **It might become essential.**
- “the driver’s **mind wanders off for a certain period**, while the **eye gaze may still be directed toward the forward road view**”
- Although it is well-documented in driver simulator-based research, researches in actual driving environments is very sparse.
- **This issue will need to be resolved in the long term.**


### **6. Occupant Classification**

- Driver/occupant classification function
- **Purpose of use**
	- Prevents airbag deployment in case of child riding (CRS; Child Restraint System) or abnormal posture (OOP; Out Of Position)
	- To link with active restraint deployment
		- Automakers are releasing headrest systems designed to relieve neck pain in back seats. When a car crashes from behind with enough force, the occupants' bodies move forward. However, if the head is not properly supported, it can be pushed back against the chest, causing neck pain, and if the head is tilted forward by the neck, a phenomenon commonly known as a whiplash fracture can occur.

### **7. Occupant present**

- Determination of whether to ride in a seat other than the driver's seat
- In particular, it will be linked to CPD(Child Presence Detection) / CRS (Child Restraint Systems).

![11](/assets/img/2024-06-19-EURONCAP-[3]:-2022---Safe-Driving.md/11.png)

- Once the occupant present is identified, it will be used to link occupant information after a vehicle collision.

### **8. Seatbelt Usage**

- A detection function is needed to go beyond the level of wearing/not wearing a seatbelt and to detect misuse of the seat belt.
